            Sir Christopher Edward Nolan (born 30 July 1970) is a British and
            American filmmaker. Known for blockbusters with complex storytelling
            produced for Hollywood studios, he is considered a leading filmmaker
            of the 21st century. Nolan's films have earned over $6.6 billion
            worldwide, making him the seventh-highest-grossing film director.
            His accolades include two Academy Awards, a Golden Globe Award and
            two British Academy Film Awards. Nolan was appointed a Commander of
            the Order of the British Empire in 2019, and received a knighthood
            in 2024 for his contributions to film.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            Nolan developed an interest in filmmaking from a young age. After
            studying English literature at University College London, he made
            several short films before his feature film debut with Following
            (1998). Nolan gained international recognition with his second film,
            Memento (2000), and transitioned into studio filmmaking with
            Insomnia (2002). He became a high-profile director with The Dark
            Knight trilogy (2005‚Äì2012), and found further success with The
            Prestige (2006), Inception (2010), Interstellar (2014), and Dunkirk
            (2017). After the release of Tenet (2020), Nolan parted ways with
            longtime distributor Warner Bros. Pictures, and signed with
            Universal Pictures for the biographical thriller Oppenheimer (2023),
            which won him Academy Awards for Best Director and Best Picture.

          <p class="lead">
            Nolan's work regularly features in the listings of best films of
            their respective decades. Infused with a metaphysical outlook, his
            films thematise epistemology, existentialism, ethics, the
            construction of time, and the malleable nature of memory and
            personal identity. They feature mathematically inspired images and
            concepts, unconventional narrative structures, practical special
            effects, experimental soundscapes, large-format film photography,
            and materialistic perspectives. He has co-written several of his
            films with his brother, Jonathan, and runs the production company
            Syncopy Inc. with his wife, Emma Thomas.

              <strong>Note:</strong>Nolan has made some of the most influential
              and popular films of his time. Many of his films have been
              regarded by critics as among the best of their respective decades

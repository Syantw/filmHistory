            Jean-Luc Godard (UK: /Àà…°…íd…ëÀê/ GOD-ar, US: /…°o äÀàd…ëÀêr/ goh-DAR;
            French: [ í…ëÃÉ lyk …°…îda Å]; 3 December 1930 ‚Äì 13 September 2022) was a
            French and Swiss film director, screenwriter, and film critic. He
            rose to prominence as a pioneer of the French New Wave film movement
            of the 1960s, alongside such filmmakers as Fran√ßois Truffaut, Agn√®s
            Varda, √âric Rohmer and Jacques Demy. He was arguably the most
            influential French filmmaker of the post-war era. According to
            AllMovie, his work "revolutionized the motion picture form" through
            its experimentation with narrative, continuity, sound, and
            camerawork.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            During his early career as a film critic for Cahiers du Cin√©ma,
            Godard criticized mainstream French cinema's "Tradition of Quality"
            and championed Hollywood directors like Alfred Hitchcock and Howard
            Hawks. In response, he and like-minded critics began to make their
            own films, challenging the conventions of traditional Hollywood in
            addition to French cinema. Godard first received global acclaim for
            Breathless (1960), a milestone in the New Wave movement. His work
            makes use of frequent homages and references to film history, and
            often expressed his political views; he was an avid reader of
            existentialism and Marxist philosophy, and in 1969 formed the Dziga
            Vertov Group with other radical filmmakers to promote political
            works. After the New Wave, his politics were less radical, and his
            later films came to be about human conflict and artistic
            representation "from a humanist rather than Marxist perspective." He
            explained that "As a critic, I thought of myself as a film-maker.
            Today I still think of myself as a critic, and in a sense I am, more
            than ever before. Instead of writing criticism, I make a film, but
            the critical dimension is subsumed."

          <p class="lead">
            Godard was married three times, to actresses Anna Karina and Anne
            Wiazemsky, both of whom starred in several of his films, and later
            to his longtime partner Anne-Marie Mi√©ville. His collaborations with
            Karina in Vivre sa vie (1962), Bande √† part (1964) and Pierrot le
            Fou (1965) were called "arguably the most influential body of work
            in the history of cinema" by Filmmaker magazine. In a 2002 Sight &
            Sound poll, Godard ranked third in the critics' top ten directors of
            all time. He is said to have "generated one of the largest bodies of
            critical analysis of any filmmaker since the mid-twentieth century."
            His work has been central to narrative theory and has "challenged
            both commercial narrative cinema norms and film criticism's
            vocabulary." In 2010, Godard was awarded an Academy Honorary Award.
            He was known for his aphorisms, such as "All you need to make a
            movie is a girl and a gun" and "A film consists of a beginning, a
            middle and an end, though not necessarily in that order."

              <strong>Note:</strong> The 60th New York Film Festival paid
              tribute to Godard, who died earlier that year. The Onion paid
              homage to him with the headline "Jean-Luc Godard Dies At End of
              Life In Uncharacteristically Linear Narrative Choice."

            Sir Alfred Joseph Hitchcock (13 August 1899 ‚Äì 29 April 1980) was an
            English film director. He is widely regarded as one of the most
            influential figures in the history of cinema. In a career spanning
            six decades, he directed over 50 feature films, many of which are
            still widely watched and studied today. Known as the
            <b>"Master of Suspense"</b>, Hitchcock became as well known as any
            of his actors thanks to his many interviews, his cameo appearances
            in most of his films, and his hosting and producing the television
            anthology

            (1955‚Äì65). His films garnered 46 Academy Award nominations,
            including six wins, although he never won the award for

            Hitchcock initially trained as a technical clerk and copywriter
            before entering the film industry in 1919 as a
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_card"> title card</a>

            (1925). His first successful film, The Lodger: A Story of the London
            Fog (1927), helped to shape the thriller genre, and Blackmail (1929)
            was the first British "talkie". His thrillers

            (1938) are ranked among the greatest British films of the 20th
            century. By 1939, he had international recognition and producer
            David O. Selznick persuaded him to move to Hollywood. A string of
            successful films followed, including Rebecca (1940), Foreign
            Correspondent (1940), Suspicion (1941), Shadow of a Doubt (1943) and
            Notorious (1946). Rebecca won the Academy Award for Best Picture,
            with Hitchcock nominated as Best Director. He also received Oscar
            nominations for Lifeboat (1944), Spellbound (1945), Rear Window
            (1954) and Psycho (1960).

          <p class="lead">
            Hitchcock's other notable films include Rope (1948), Strangers on a
            Train (1951), Dial M for Murder (1954), To Catch a Thief (1955), The
            Trouble with Harry (1955), Vertigo (1958), North by Northwest
            (1959), The Birds (1963) and Marnie (1964), all of which were also
            financially successful and are highly regarded by film historians.
            Hitchcock made a number of films with some of the biggest stars in
            Hollywood, including four with Cary Grant, four with James Stewart,
            three with Ingrid Bergman and three consecutively with Grace Kelly.
            Hitchcock became an American citizen in 1955.

            In 2012, Hitchcock's psychological thriller Vertigo, starring
            Stewart, displaced Orson Welles' Citizen Kane (1941) as the British
            Film Institute's greatest film ever made based on its world-wide
            poll of hundreds of film critics. As of 2021, nine of his films had
            been selected for preservation in the United States National Film
            Registry, including his personal favourite, Shadow of a Doubt
            (1943). He received the BAFTA Fellowship in 1971, the AFI Life
            Achievement Award in 1979, and was knighted in December of that
            year, four months before his death on 29 April 1980.

              <strong>Note:</strong>In 1978, John Russell Taylor described him
              as "the most universally recognizable person in the world" and "a
              straightforward middle-class Englishman who just happened to be an
              artistic genius".

            Sir Charles Spencer Chaplin (16 April 1889 – 25 December 1977) was
            an English comic actor, filmmaker, and composer who rose to fame in
            the era of <em>silent film</em>. He became a worldwide icon through
            his screen persona, <em>the Tramp</em>, and is considered one of the
            film industry's most important figures. His career spanned more than
            75 years, from his childhood in the <em>Victorian era</em> until a
            year before his death in 1977, and encompassed both accolade and
            controversy.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            Chaplin's childhood in London was one of poverty and hardship. His
            father was absent and his mother struggled financially – he was sent
            to a <em>workhouse</em> twice before age nine. When he was 14, his
            mother was committed to a
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_asylum"
              >mental asylum</a
            >. Chaplin began performing at an early age, touring
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_hall">music halls</a>
            and later working as a stage actor and comedian. At 19, he was
            signed to the
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Karno"> Fred Karno </a>
            company, which took him to the United States. He was scouted for the
            film industry and began appearing in 1914 for
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystone_Studios"
              >Keystone Studios</a
            >. He soon introduced and adopted the Tramp as his screen persona.
            He directed his own films and continued to hone his craft as he
            moved to
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essanay_Studios"
              >Essanay Studios</a
            >, where the Tramp persona was developed emotionally in

            (1915). He then attracted a large fanbase and demanded more money as
            he moved to Mutual and First National corporations. By 1918, he was
            one of the world's best-paid and best-known figures.

          <p class="lead">
            In 1919, Chaplin co-founded the distribution company United Artists,
            which gave him complete control over his films. His first
            feature-length film was The Kid (1921), followed by A Woman of Paris
            (1923), The Gold Rush (1925), and The Circus (1928). He initially
            refused to move to sound films in the 1930s, instead producing City
            Lights (1931) and Modern Times (1936) without dialogue. His first
            sound film was The Great Dictator (1940), which satirised Adolf
            Hitler. The 1940s were marked with controversy for Chaplin, and his
            popularity declined rapidly. He was accused of communist sympathies,
            and some members of the press and public were scandalised by his
            involvement in a paternity suit and marriages to much younger women.
            An FBI investigation was opened, and Chaplin was forced to leave the
            U.S. in 1952 and settle in Switzerland. He abandoned the Tramp in
            his later films, which include Monsieur Verdoux (1947), Limelight
            (1952), A King in New York (1957), and A Countess from Hong Kong
            (1967).

          <p class="lead">
            Chaplin wrote, directed, produced, edited, starred in, and composed
            the music for most of his films. He was a perfectionist, and his
            financial independence enabled him to spend years on the development
            and production of a picture. His films are characterised by
            slapstick combined with pathos, typified in the Tramp's struggles
            against adversity. Many contain social and political themes, as well
            as autobiographical elements. He received an Honorary Academy Award
            for "the incalculable effect he has had in making motion pictures
            the art form of this century" in 1972, as part of a renewed
            appreciation for his work. He continues to be held in high regard,
            with The Gold Rush, City Lights, Modern Times, and The Great
            Dictator often ranked on lists of the greatest films.

              director René Clair wrote, "He was a monument of the cinema, of
              all countries and all times ... the most beautiful gift the cinema
              made to us."

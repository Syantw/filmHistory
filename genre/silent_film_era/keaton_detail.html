            Joseph Frank "Buster" Keaton (October 4, 1895 ‚Äì February 1, 1966)[1]
            was an American actor, comedian and filmmaker. He is best known for
            his <b>silent films</b> during the 1920s, in which he performed

            </b>
            and inventive stunts. He frequently maintained a stoic, deadpan
            facial expression that became his trademark and earned him the
            nickname "The Great Stone Face".
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            Keaton was a child vaudeville star, performing as part of his
            family's traveling act. As an adult, he began working with
            independent producer Joseph M. Schenck and filmmaker Edward F.
            Cline, with whom he made a series of successful two-reel comedies in
            the early 1920s, including One Week (1920), The Playhouse (1921),
            Cops (1922), and The Electric House (1922). He then moved to
            feature-length films; several of them, such as Sherlock Jr. (1924),
            The General (1926), Steamboat Bill, Jr. (1928), and The Cameraman
            (1928), remain highly regarded.[5] The General is perhaps his most
            acclaimed work; Orson Welles considered it "the greatest comedy ever
            made...and perhaps the greatest film ever made".

            In 1919, Chaplin co-founded the distribution company United Artists,
            which gave him complete control over his films. His first
            feature-length film was The Kid (1921), followed by A Woman of Paris
            (1923), The Gold Rush (1925), and The Circus (1928). He initially
            refused to move to sound films in the 1930s, instead producing City
            Lights (1931) and Modern Times (1936) without dialogue. His first
            sound film was The Great Dictator (1940), which satirised Adolf
            Hitler. The 1940s were marked with controversy for Chaplin, and his
            popularity declined rapidly. He was accused of communist sympathies,
            and some members of the press and public were scandalised by his
            involvement in a paternity suit and marriages to much younger women.
            An FBI investigation was opened, and Chaplin was forced to leave the
            U.S. in 1952 and settle in Switzerland. He abandoned the Tramp in
            his later films, which include Monsieur Verdoux (1947), Limelight
            (1952), A King in New York (1957), and A Countess from Hong Kong
            (1967).

          <p class="lead">
            Keaton's career declined after 1928, when he signed with
            Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and lost his artistic independence. His first
            wife divorced him, and he descended into alcoholism. He was fired
            from MGM in 1933, ending his career as a leading man in feature
            films. He recovered in the 1940s, marrying Eleanor Norris and
            working as an honored comic performer until the end of his life.
            During this period, he made cameos in Billy Wilder's Sunset
            Boulevard (1950), Charlie Chaplin's Limelight (1952), and a variety
            of television programs. He earned an Academy Honorary Award in 1959.

              <strong>Note:</strong> In 1996, Entertainment Weekly recognized
              Keaton as the seventh-greatest film director, stating that "his
              films offer belly laughs of mind-boggling physical invention and a
              spacey determination that nears philosophical grandeur."

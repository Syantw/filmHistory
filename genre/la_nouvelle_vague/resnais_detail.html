          <p class="lead">
            Alain Resnais (French: [alɛ̃ ʁɛnɛ]; 3 June 1922 – 1 March 2014) was a
            French film director and screenwriter whose career extended over
            more than six decades. After training as a film editor in the
            mid-1940s, he went on to direct short films including Night and Fog
            (1956), an influential documentary about the Nazi concentration
            camps.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            Resnais began making feature films in the late 1950s and
            consolidated his early reputation with Hiroshima mon amour (1959),
            Last Year at Marienbad (1961), and Muriel (1963), all of which
            adopted unconventional narrative techniques to deal with themes of
            troubled memory and the imagined past. These films were contemporary
            with, and associated with, the French New Wave (la nouvelle vague),
            though Resnais did not regard himself as being fully part of that
            movement. He had closer links to the "Left Bank" group of authors
            and filmmakers who shared a commitment to modernism and an interest
            in left-wing politics. He also established a regular practice of
            working on his films in collaboration with writers previously
            unconnected with the cinema such as Jean Cayrol, Marguerite Duras,
            Alain Robbe-Grillet, Jorge Semprún and Jacques Sternberg
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            In later films, Resnais moved away from the overtly political topics
            of some previous works and developed his interests in an interaction
            between cinema and other cultural forms, including theatre, music,
            and comic books. This led to imaginative adaptations of plays by
            Alan Ayckbourn, Henri Bernstein and Jean Anouilh, as well as films
            featuring various kinds of popular song.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            His films frequently explore the relationship between consciousness,
            memory, and the imagination, and he was noted for devising
            innovative formal structures for his narratives.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            Throughout his career, he won many awards from international film
            festivals and academies, including one Academy Award, two César
            Awards for best director (he was nominated on eight occasions),
            three Louis Delluc Prize and one Golden Lion at the Venice Film
            Festival.

              <strong>Note:</strong>He defined his own relationship by saying:
              "Although I was not fully part of the New Wave because of my age,
              there was some mutual sympathy and respect between myself and
              Rivette, Bazin, Demy, Truffaut ... So I felt friendly with that
              team."

            Lang's work spans five decades, from the Expressionist silent films
            of his first German creative period to his short stay in Paris and
            his work as a Hollywood director to his last three films made in
            Germany. Lang's most celebrated films include the futuristic
            science-fiction film <b>Metropolis</b> (1927) and the influential

            the concept of a rocket launch pad (a rocket standing upright

            In 1919, Chaplin co-founded the distribution company United Artists,
            which gave him complete control over his films. His first
            feature-length film was The Kid (1921), followed by A Woman of Paris
            (1923), The Gold Rush (1925), and The Circus (1928). He initially
            refused to move to sound films in the 1930s, instead producing City
            Lights (1931) and Modern Times (1936) without dialogue. His first
            sound film was The Great Dictator (1940), which satirised Adolf
            Hitler. The 1940s were marked with controversy for Chaplin, and his
            popularity declined rapidly. He was accused of communist sympathies,
            and some members of the press and public were scandalised by his
            involvement in a paternity suit and marriages to much younger women.
            An FBI investigation was opened, and Chaplin was forced to leave the
            U.S. in 1952 and settle in Switzerland. He abandoned the Tramp in
            his later films, which include Monsieur Verdoux (1947), Limelight
            (1952), A King in New York (1957), and A Countess from Hong Kong
            (1967).

              Germany's school of Expressionism, he was dubbed the "Master of
              Darkness" by the British Film Institute. He has been cited as one

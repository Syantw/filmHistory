            Frank Russell Capra (born Francesco Rosario Capra; May 18, 1897 –
            September 3, 1991) was an Italian-American film director, producer,
            and screenwriter who was the creative force behind

            rags-to-riches story has led film historians such as Ian Freer to
            consider him the "American Dream personified".

          <p class="lead">
            Capra became one of America's most influential directors during the
            1930s, winning three Academy Awards for Best Director from six
            nominations, along with three other Oscar wins from nine nominations
            in other categories. Among his leading films were It Happened One
            Night (1934), Mr. Deeds Goes to Town (1936),

            Corps and produced propaganda films, such as the

            series.

          <p class="lead">
            After World War II, Capra's career declined as his later films, such

            (1946), performed poorly when they were first released. Beginning in
            1950, his cinematic output slowed, and he retired from filmmaking in
            the mid-1960s. In the ensuing decades, however, It's a Wonderful
            Life and other Capra films were revisited favorably by critics.
            Outside of directing, Capra was active in the film industry,
            engaging in various political and social activities. He served as
            President of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, worked
            alongside the Writers Guild of America, and was head of the
            Directors Guild of America.

              <strong>Note:</strong> Like his contemporary, director John Ford,
              Capra defined and aggrandized the tropes of mythic America where
              individual courage invariably triumphs over collective evil.

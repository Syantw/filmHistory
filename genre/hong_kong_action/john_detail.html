            John Woo Yu-sen SBS (Chinese: Âê≥ÂÆáÊ£Æ; born 22 September 1946) is a
            Hong Kong film director known as a highly influential figure in the
            action film genre. The recipient of various accolades, including a
            Hong Kong Film Award for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best
            Editing, as well as a Golden Horse Award, an Asia Pacific Screen
            Award and a Saturn Award, he is regarded as a pioneer of heroic
            bloodshed films and the gun fu genre in Hong Kong action cinema. He
            is known for his highly chaotic "bullet ballet" action sequences,
            stylized imagery, Mexican standoffs, frequent use of slow motion and
            allusions to wuxia, film noir and Western cinema.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            Considered one of the major figures of Hong Kong cinema, Woo has
            directed several notable action films. He is known for his
            collaborations with actor Chow Yun-fat in five Hong Kong action
            films: A Better Tomorrow (1986), which made Chow a box-office
            superstar in Asia, A Better Tomorrow II (1987), The Killer (1989),
            Once a Thief (1991), and Hard Boiled (1992). He has also directed
            martial arts films such as The Dragon Tamers (1975), Hand of Death
            (1976), and Last Hurrah for Chivalry (1979), and action comedies
            such as Follow the Star (1978), From Riches to Rags (1980), Run,
            Tiger, Run (1984), and Once a Thief (1991).
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            Hard Target (1993), starring Jean-Claude Van Damme, was his first
            American directorial debut, and the first major Hollywood film made
            by a Chinese director. His other Hollywood films include Broken
            Arrow (1996), Face/Off (1997) and Mission: Impossible 2 (2000). He
            made his Canadian debut with the action comedy film Once a Thief
            (1996), which is a remake of Woo's 1991 film of the same name. He
            continued to be active in Hong Kong cinema, directing films such as
            the two-part historical epic The Crossing (2014). His first
            Chinese-language feature since Hard Boiled (1992) was the
            internationally co-produced Red Cliff (2008-2009), which broke the
            Chinese box office record previously held by Titanic in mainland
            China.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            Woo is the creator of the comic series Seven Brothers, published by
            Virgin Comics. He is the founder and chairman of the production
            company Lion Rock Productions.

            Joseph Hill "Joss" Whedon (/ÀàwiÀêd…ôn/ WEE-d…ôn; born June 23, 1964) is
            an American screenwriter, director, producer, comic book writer, and
            composer. He is best known as the creator of several television
            series: the supernatural drama Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1997‚Äì2003)
            and its spinoff Angel (1999‚Äì2004), the short-lived space Western
            Firefly (2002), the Internet musical miniseries Dr. Horrible's
            Sing-Along Blog (2008), the science fiction drama Dollhouse
            (2009‚Äì2010), the Marvel Cinematic Universe film The Avengers (2012)
            and series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (2013‚Äì2020), and the science
            fiction drama The Nevers (2021).
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            After beginning his career in sitcoms, Whedon wrote the poorly
            received horror comedy film Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1992) ‚Äì which
            he later adapted into the acclaimed television series of the same
            name ‚Äì co-wrote the Pixar animated film Toy Story (1995), and wrote
            the science fiction horror film Alien Resurrection (1997). After
            achieving success as a television showrunner, Whedon returned to
            film to write and direct the Firefly film continuation Serenity
            (2005), co-write and produce the horror comedy film The Cabin in the
            Woods (2012), and write and direct the Shakespeare adaptation Much
            Ado About Nothing (2012). For the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Whedon
            wrote and directed the ensemble superhero film The Avengers (2012)
            and its sequel Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015). He also co-wrote the
            DC Extended Universe superhero film Justice League (2017), for which
            he also served as director for re-shoots, replacing Zack Snyder (who
            retained directorial credit).
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            Whedon has also worked as a composer (notably for the Buffy the
            Vampire Slayer musical episode "Once More, with Feeling" and Dr.
            Horrible's Sing-Along Blog) and comic book writer, both for comic
            book continuations of television series he created and for
            established franchises, such as Astonishing X-Men.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            Beginning in July 2020, multiple actors, producers, and writers
            spoke out against Whedon following the toxic workplace environment
            he had allegedly created in many of his projects. Whedon has denied
            any wrongdoing, while acknowledging that he can be
            "confrontational".

            <p>
              <strong>Note:</strong> Elements of feminism are present throughout
              much of Whedon's work[280] and he gives his mother credit for
              inspiring this.
